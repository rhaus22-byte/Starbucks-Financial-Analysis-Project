Starbucks has created such a name for itself that it has become something of a trend to be a customer of the company due to its inviting environment. When you walk into a Starbucks café you are greeted with dim lighting as well as a darker colored theme which is easy on the eyes. Most locations have ample seating which makes for a great location to meet with friends and family as well as doing tasks for work and school. But how was Starbucks able to expand to the size that they are today? Starbucks is currently the number one coffee chain in the world with over 35000 locations! Starbucks started in 1971 where they opened their first shop in Seattle Washington which is where their corporate headquarters remains today. The original owners of the business did not have any intentions of expanding however a man named Howard Schultz, who joined the company in 1982, would later go on to become the Chief Executive Officer of the company and expand their footprint after a desire to bring Italy's style of coffeehouses to America (Starbucks, 2024). From this point on Starbucks has been expanding their footprint into many other countries in the world for everyone to experience.\n\nWhile Starbucks primarily is known for their coffee concoctions they serve, they also sell other products. These include breakfast sandwiches, breads, desserts, custom coffee mugs and other accessories, and more. The introduction of more food items has helped Starbucks to attract a larger customer base as well as helping to retain customers in the café for longer periods of time. Along with the products Starbucks offers they also were the first major coffee chain to popularize mobile ordering, which we see not only in other coffee retailers but also other food and beverage retailers. Starbucks has been very successful at appealing to multiple different demographics as well as geographical locations across the world. With that being said, Starbucks demographic is largely made up of people aged from 25 to 40 years old. \"These individuals are often social urbanites, who are heavy users of the latest technology and are almost always connected via social media. They are very much part of a trendy culture and have middle income to high-income levels. This strategy is reflected in the design of the cafes and the music played in-store. The contemporary design of many Starbucks cafes is deliberate - the aim is to create a relaxed atmosphere where customers can enjoy their coffee. The music played is a blend of the very latest and tried and tested songs from the last 40 years, something that also fits in with the tastes of that age group\" (Brodowicz, 2024). Starbucks is not only located in America but focuses on expansion in other countries such as Europe, Africa, and Asia. \"In recent years, Starbucks' marketing department has been focusing on dividing the wide consumer market into specific groups based on the geographic location. This kind of strategy ensures that all the efforts of the marketing team go to waste. It also helps to align the marketing mix, i.e. the four Ps of marketing - price, product, place, and promotion. When you visit the urban areas like in New York, you will notice that there is a Starbucks shop after every few meters. These urban areas have high traffic of people and that many of them have high purchasing power\" (Brodowicz, 2024). Because of this Starbucks uses ample marketing efforts in each country to tailor their products and services to meet the needs of each customer base. This is also done through the designs of their coffee shops which fit the traditions and cultures of each country. An example of this is in Japan when Starbucks offers a cherry blossom themed menu which is a very popular flower in Japan.\n\nWhile Starbucks is currently the leading coffee chain in the world that does not mean that they are not exposed to fierce competition and the risk that comes with that. Some of the major competitors that Starbucks faces include Dunkin Donuts, McDonald's, Tim Hortons, Folgers, Maxwell House, and Keurig. Currently Starbucks' primary competition is with Dunkin Donuts. This competition is very apparent among social media platforms as both companies at times make implying comments about each other as well as follow very similarly in the products and services that they offer. \"In 2006, Dunkin' upped the ante and declared war against Starbucks when it launched its \"America Runs on Dunkin'\" ad campaign. While Starbucks has created an intentionally chic and upscale environment, Dunkin' Donuts represents itself as an All-American brand. In December 2020, Inspire Brands completed an \\$11.3 billion acquisition of Dunkin' Brands. The coffee and donut chain now has more than 13,700 locations in 38 global markets\" (Ita, 2024). Because of this competition Starbucks must remain diligent in their marketing efforts as well as managing their financial information accordingly.\n\nThe way that Starbucks is able to operate in the most efficient manner is by creating a SWOT analysis to assess their current market standing and ways that they can improve and expand. A SWOT analysis stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Starbuck's strengths include strong brand recognition, strong customer loyalty, a strong digital and global presence, and a commitment to sustainability. Starbucks weaknesses include major dependence on a single product line, limited international expansion, negative impact of commodity price fluctuations, and dependance on brick-and-mortar stores. Starbucks opportunities include expanding into new markets, collaborations with other companies or brands, new product creation, coffee subscriptions, and expanding on the Starbucks rewards loyalty program. Starbucks threats include competition from other coffee chains as well as independent coffee shops, changes in consumer preferences or trends, economic fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, and employee turnover (Pereira, 2023). Starbucks SWOT analysis shows that there are clearly many strengths that have helped them grow to the point where they are today despite facing competition and other negative factors in their way.\n\nAfter assessing the opportunities posed in Starbucks SWOT analysis it is clear that there are many different ways in which the company can innovate and expand. As of 2024 Starbucks' business strategy and goal is to expand the number of stores it has, offer new and unique products, and have a goal of maintaining and potentially increasing their market share. \"The company's growth momentum remains strong, with 526 net new store openings in Q3 (of which 141 were in North America). For FY 2024, the company has planned a total of 580 new stores added, with renovations planned in more than 800 stores in North America. This strategic expansion is poised to fuel revenue growth, solidifying Starbucks' market position and driving future profitability\" (Forbes, 2024). Branching off of this success Starbucks rolled out a new coffee called the \"Pecan Crunch Oatmilk Latte\" to try to attract more customers especially during the fall and winter holidays. Being that this product was only released several weeks ago we are yet to see if the momentum is maintained for this product or if sales will see a decline. It appears that Starbucks is on track to achieve their business goal for 2024 with only Q4 remaining, but it will be interesting to see how everything pans out.\n\nLike many companies Starbucks uses GAAP procedures as part of their accounting processes. GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which is created by our government to ensure that businesses follow correct and orderly procedures when reporting information on their financial statements. The primary method of accounting that Starbucks uses is the accrual accounting method. \"Accrual accounting is the recognition of revenue when earned and the matching of expenses when incurred. Starbucks records revenue from 4 different sources: Company-operated stores, licensed stores, CPG foodservice and other revenues, and stored value cards\" (Conn-Powers et al., 2017). Under the accrual accounting method Starbucks records their revenues and expenses when they occur rather than when a payment is received or made, which helps to show a better timeline of when each financial transaction occurs. Along with the accrual accounting method Starbucks also uses two different methods of reporting depreciation which is the straight-line method and the accelerated depreciation method. Starbucks uses these depreciation methods depending on which type of product, service, and/or asset they are assessing as well as for when they must report taxes. Using GAAP principles is important for Starbucks and any company to follow to ensure that their financial information being reported is not only accurate but to make sure they are operating in legal guidelines so as not to show an inaccurate depiction of their financial standing.\n\nAfter analyzing the financial statements such as the balance sheets and income statements for Starbucks from 2021 through 2023 I was able to calculate valuable financial ratios which can give us a better understanding of the financial position that Starbucks is in. The first ratio which helps show Starbucks growth is their total asset turnover. This ratio shows how much of Starbucks assets they can turn into sales. In 2021 this ratio was 0.93. In 2022 the ratio was 1.15. In 2023 the ratio was 1.22. A higher asset turnover ratio is better for a company because it shows that they can turn more sales from their total assets in which Starbucks has shown a rise in this ratio. Another ratio which shows Starbucks' growth is the inventory turnover ratio which shows the efficiency of the inventory Starbucks sells as well as how quickly they are able to replace it. In 2021 this ratio was 5.45. In 2022 the ratio was 4.74. In 2023 the ratio was 6.32. This shows that the company experienced a dip in demand for their product in 2022 but was able to increase the figure in 2023. Another important ratio which shows Starbucks growth is their return on equity which shows how the firm is able to turn their equity into profit leading to further expansion. In 2021 this ratio was -79.01%. In 2022 the ratio was -37.72%. In 2023 the ratio was -51.63%. While a negative roe can signal a bad sign to growth of the company, Starbucks has been repurchasing their shares over the last several years which explains this negative figure. Branching off of Starbucks growth they have also been consistently profitable over the years. One ratio that shows this is the net profit margin which is the profit that they maintain after expenses are deducted. In 2021 this ratio was 14.45%. In 2022 the ratio was 10.18%. In 2023 the ratio was 11.46%. While the ratio has come down from 2021 Starbucks has still been able to maintain profitability in the company. Another ratio showing Starbucks profitability is the operating profit margin which tells us how much profit Starbucks is able generate after factoring in all operating expenses. In 2021 this ratio was 16.82%. In 2022 the ratio was 11.62%. In 2023 the ratio was 13.49%. Clearly Starbucks has been able to maintain profitability throughout the years especially due to the volume of sales it receives each year. Although Starbucks has maintained profitability they show signs of reduced efficiency in the company. Two ratios that have shown this to be a problem is the total debt to equity as well as the total long-term debt to equity which both show how efficient the firm is able to utilize its capital to expand using debt and equity. Throughout 2021 to 2023 both of these figures have been negative which signals that the company has more debts than assets. Another ratio that shows Starbucks efficiency is their working capital turnover which is the relationship between turning their working capital into sales. In 2021 this ratio was 18.1. In 2022 the ratio was -15.1. In 2023 the ratio was -17.6. This shows that Starbucks has seen a dramatic decline in their operating efficiency over the years. Another possibly problematic measure of Starbucks financial performance is its liquidity. An important ratio that shows this is the current ratio which tells us how liquid the company is to pay its short-term debt obligations. In 2021 this ratio was 1.19. In 2022 the ratio was 0.76. In 2023 the ratio was 0.78. This ratio has been underperforming over the years which is likely due to the excess liabilities the company has relative to its assets. The firms acid-test ratio has also seen a decline over the years. What the acid-test ratio shows us is the liquidity of a company to repay its debt using not only cash but marketable securities and accounts receivable. In 2021 this ratio was 0.91. In 2022 the ratio was 0.44. In 2023 the ratio was 0.51. This shows that the company is not using many liquid assets to pay its liabilities.\n\nThe market's perception of the company has generally been very good for Starbucks, which has helped propel growth opportunities for them. An article studied closer how buyers perceive Starbucks and how brand recognition has influenced Starbucks to get to the size it is today. It is explained, \"Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and interviews, data was collected from a diverse sample of Starbucks customers across different demographics and locations. Key findings reveal that Starbucks customers perceive the brand positively, associating it with quality, convenience, and a welcoming atmosphere\" (Moses & Riyazuddin, 2024). While Starbucks has consistently grown over the last several years, especially due to its brand recognition, marketing, and financial information, there are still ways in which Starbucks can improve its cash flow as well as expand its market share at an even greater rate. If I were in an executive position at Starbucks, I would first want to look at the negative ratios that have appeared over the last 3 years and work on a strategy to increase those ratios to a more favorable value. The first metric I would look at is either reducing the amount of debt financing that the firm has or increase the amount of equity financing. The reason for this is because of the large imbalance of debt to equity leading to negative ratios. If a firm has a majority of its financing in either equity or debt it can pose additional risk in the event that there are not enough investors to aid in making payments or if a firm does not have enough cash on hand to make payments. Another metric I would look at is the total expenses for the business. Many of the ratios calculated are unfavorable because of the large amount of liabilities in comparison to the total assets of the firm. After researching further, I discovered that Starbucks actually has increasing efficiency as part of their goal to reduce their total expenses. It is explained on their website, \"We will implement a 3 billion efficiency program, 2 billion outside the store in cost of goods sold, to both reinvest in the business and to deliver returns to shareholders through margin expansion and earnings growth\" (Tan, 2023). In part of the goal to reduce costs I would implement a strategy to increase Starbucks digital footprint and find more ways to increase sales without opening excess brick and mortar locations which cut into profits greatly. If the firm is able to cut additional costs then it can use that revenue to invest in things such as shareholders, increasing investments to scale future growth, create more innovative products, and increase marketing efforts. Lastly, I would create a strategy to bring an older customer base to Starbucks since now it is primarily made up of young to middle-aged people. This can be done through offering incentives for becoming a Starbucks rewards member, tailoring new drink ideas to drinks that an older generation would prefer, and more. If the firm is able to increase its customer base and generate more sales it can also help to fuel its growth leading to higher revenues and net income on their financial statements.\n\nSince Starbucks inception it has become the leader in the world in the coffee industry. What was originally only a small coffee shop in Seattle Washington that only had intentions of remaining in the city now has expanded to unfathomable heights. Starbucks has been able to cultivate a relationship with its customer base by creating an undeniable brand recognition, various products and services, and an inviting atmosphere that all people can feel comfortable entering. Although Starbucks is the number one coffee retailer in the world, they still have a lot to do to increase their sales as well as cutting expenses. Starbucks has many goals such as increasing their footprint in their existing stores as well as expanding into even more international locations. I think if Starbucks were able to give back to their shareholders more then they may be able to increase their expansion into new markets at a faster rate. Even with profitability coming to a flatline with the firm I still predict that the company will be able to expand further because of how strong its customer base is and the community feel that the business instills into every location it opens.\n\n**References**\n\nBrodowicz, M.
